#Hugging Face - Case Study

> Prior to the founding of Hugging Face, CEO Clement Delangue founded Unishared in 2011, the idea formed in college while sitting in a lecture hall.  He was frustrated with the standard, archaic seating arrangement with everyone facing forward to listen to a guest lecturer and where everyone was taking the exact same notes. He also disliked staring at the back of people’s heads and felt isolated even in a room filled with fellow students. For Mr. Delangue, he wanted a connection with the people around him and did this through tweeting where he shared his grievance about the situation, “Why would we be doing that…without sharing with each other.  Without sharing externally?” (Eifling 2023, para. 2) His belief was that everyone was missing out on collaborating and sharing insights with a community of students who had the luxury of being able to afford a higher education. That night, he began work on a solution.  

> By 2016, Mr. Delangue wanted to create another concept, so he connected with Julien Chaumond, now CTO, and a third friend to work on solving “the most difficult problems they could identify in the field of machine learning. The trio aimed to leverage a technology called NLP to build an open domain, conversational AI chatbot.” (Eifling 2023, para. 11) They wanted to build a fun, conversational AI that could talk with you about anything. This was the beginning of Hugging Face, it was an “AI best friend forever (BFF)” (Osman, Sewell 2022, para. 4) chatbot for teenagers that could be interactive and provide emotional support and entertainment based on ones needs. 

Since the beginning, The Hugging Face founders instilled with their employees, democracy, and empowerment to take ownership of their own products when creating features for the chatbot. This moved the company in the direction of an open source with the NLP models powering the chatbot and where this type of environment became popular with the AI developer community.  It was then decided to fully shift from the chatbot app and begin collecting large NLP models and make everything open source. 

> Hugging Face is an open-source repository, where individuals and companies can find, freely available AI models, including those developed by Google, Meta and Microsoft, who incidentally, also use Hugging Face. In its bio, Hugging Face states it “is the collaboration platform for the machine learning community. The Hugging Face Hub works as a central place where anyone can share, explore, discover, and experiment with open-source ML. HF empowers the next generation of machine learning engineers, scientists, and end users to learn, collaborate and share their work to build an open and ethical AI future together.” (Hugging Face Bio 2023)

> As of August 2023, Hugging Face has raised 95M through Series D Funding from investors such as, Lux Capital, Sequoia, Coatue, Addition and A.Capital.

From the start, Hugging Face founders wanted a distinctive business model compared to their competitors and even other businesses. This one would be inspired by a democratic, community of collaboration not only for its employees but also with the individuals and companies who utilize the Hub to ultimately overcome the high costs of implementing AI technology.  

Customers who utilize Hugging Face varies from an individual using the free service features to large enterprise, paying customers seeking expert support and security, model hosting and other features it has to offer. 

As of June 2022, the company had over 1,000 customers including Intel, Qualcomm, Pfizer, Bloomberg, and eBay. A year later, Hugging Face state they have increased to 10,000 customers that also now include Google and Microsoft. 

> Per Fortune Business Insights, “the global Natural Language Processing (NLP) market size was valued at $19.68B in 2022 and is projected to grow from $24.10B in 2023 to $112.28B in 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 24.6% during the forecast period.” (Fortune Business Insights 2023, para. 1) The escalated market growth of digital technology software can be attributed to enterprises and global businesses adopting this new digital technology into their business fold. As of 3rd quarter of this year, the US is the leading region of the NLP market with an estimated 23.2%. Key companies like IBM, Oracle and Microsoft dominate this market. I conclude that Hugging Face has a potential of a few percentage points of the US market share. 

As previously mentioned, the difference with Hugging Face compared to its competitors is their business model being democratized and community oriented, in addition the company offers a platform that allows individuals to build off each other’s work when sharing models while using innovative NLP technology and user-friendly tools. Hugging Face built a strong, energetic, and enthusiastic following where the community continually advocates for its success. 

Hugging Face’s unique business model has attributed to its success and has been years in the making, which could be seen as an unfair advantage. This company found a solution that caters to an individual, small business and large enterprises but found a remedy to the issue with the high cost of capital it takes to implement new technology and removed that from the equation by building models that can be freely acquired and tweaked to the benefit of the user.  A majority of Hugging Face’s competitors’ business models are based on selling a product that is focused on serving large corporations. It’s possible for a business to shift to this business model but it would be an expensive undertaking and take years to change the culture it has created with their employees and customers. 

AI has moved at lightning speed over the years. Mainly based on how much money companies have been willing to spend on the development of the technology.  Another important aspect is how quickly AI has been able to learn from the amount of data that it’s fed. The combination of these 2 elements will continue to propel us to explore the infinite possibilities of AI. 

We have been introduced to some notable AI and machine learning technologies throughout the years.  For instance, in 2011 Watson, IBM’s question and answer system defeated 2 Jeopardy Champions.  Then in 2013, Boston Dynamics created Atlas which is a humanoid type of robot that could drive a car, climb a ladder, and close doors. Next, there was Google assistant that made an appearance in 2016, it did internet searches, scheduled events, and set alarms. By 2019, Pluribus, learned how to play poker and win, it also continued to teach itself with the use of deep machine learning. In 2020, AI and ML predicted the spread of Covid and carried out virtual tests to find appropriate treatments. This year, as AI advancement has been realized, concerning issues have been bought to the forefront such as how to democratize access to AI and the need to address the ethics and responsibility of AI.  

Hugging Face has been devoting effort to these issues since its beginning. Their platform is already open source and free to both nonpaying and paying customers.  And, there is an internal community discussing ideas to combat ethical concerns and posts quarterly newsletters highlighting these endeavors. 

> There are a few core metrics AI companies can use to measure performance, identify problems, and maintain accountability, such as, for machine learning is the mean squared error (MSE) “to measure the accuracy of predictive models in AI.” (Matson, para. 16) Another metric to consider is “Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), or how long it takes to fix a failed component or device.” (Sullivan 2023, para. 1) Lastly, the use of ROI which measures how long it would take to make the return on investment. Unfortunately, since Hugging Face is still held privately, there is no available metrics data. 

Hugging Face competitors include H2O.ai, spaCy, Roboflow, Haystack NLP, LangChain, and LlamaIndex. 

Based on money raised and current valuations, Hugging Face is in the lead with $395M raised in 2023 with a valuation of $4.5B.  In 2021, Hugging Face says they made about $10M in revenue and this year will bring in an estimated $30M-$50M.

Right behind is H2O.ai who is also a privately held company and deems itself as a democratizing AI that supports a user to own their models. This company has total funding of $262.5M and valuation of $1.7B.  It’s been difficult to track revenue due to it being private, but estimated revenue has ranged from $5M - $69M. But this company seems to also lean towards selling their own software and other products. This month in eWeek article “13 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software in 2023” H2O.ai was listed. 

Haystack, by Deepset, another open-source NLP framework, it’s main use is with Retriever-Reader pipelines.  In 2022 it raised $14M in Series A investment, then in Aug 2023 it raised $30M to make improvements by offering a cloud platform called Deepset Cloud. And Valuation is estimated at $99M.

LlamaIndex raises $8.5M in seed funding this year, it’s an up-and-coming startup but growing quickly with the addition of their own open-source project. No valuation at this time.  It will be interesting to watch the growth of this one. The company helps developers manage their data for LLM applications but focus on connecting data source with LLM.   

As Hugging Face continues with its success with the open source and democratization of AI business model, they will receive questions from investors around the status of other revenue sources.  What I saw lacking were any licensed Hugging Face line of technologies that other competitors offer. Hugging Face builds models for the open-source platform that can be freely adopted based on the user’s selected subscription plan which is commendable. But to continue to fund this endeavor, an increase in the revenue stream is required.  

My recommendation is to offer a Hugging Face licensed line of technologies catered for businesses and have a separate, corporate subscription plan. This way, there would be the initial revenue of the sale of a technology package and then a continued payment with a subscription plan. Packages could be a variation of off the shelf models, datasets, autotrain and a space for companies who have yet to venture into AI and may have a few data scientists on staff to support this effort but want to test the technology and immediately implement. This would be quick installation, and the customer can see a quick return on the investment. For the larger corporations, a complex system capable of supporting multiple business units, again focused on core technologies of models and datasets but also include Autotrain, multiple Spaces that can be customized for a company and inclusion of the Interface API.  

For example, licensing Autotrain, by tailoring for a large business where users can upload data onto the company’s own internal platform and still maintains the same function where it automatically finds the best model for the data entered, then trains, evaluates and deploys to scale. For Spaces, again this would provide a company its own internal platform for developers to build, host and share models with colleagues and support interactive demos. And finally, adapting an Interface API for a large company will allow the organization to have its own infrastructure to support building large ML models in house. These options, will allow customers to have their own environment, control users, and keep data private since not all companies can or want to share their data like in the defense and utilities industry.

Hugging Face has a good variety of core products and instead of adding additional products at this time, it would be best to fine tune its current state so it can maintain its positive status with their community and expand in segments to maintain better control.
